<h1>Marco's top 3 movies of all-time.</h1>
<hr />
<h3>Taxi Driver </h3>
<p>Shot amazingly. One of the few movies where narration actually works for me.</p>
<h3>Superbad</h3>
<p>Best comedy in my opinion. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera at their funniest.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
